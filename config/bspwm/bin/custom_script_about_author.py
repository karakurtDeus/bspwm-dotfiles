My name is {AUTHOR_FIRST_NAME}, also known as {AUTHOR_NICKNAME}.
This is a console-like system built on top of bspwm.

The main idea is simplicity and speed:
no heavy UI layers (like eww), everything is controlled through
keybindings and minimal interfaces.

I have been working as a SecDevOps / SRE engineer for 6+ years,
and I needed a system optimized for daily work and learning.

System management is implemented in Python — clean, readable,
and easier to maintain (for me) than shell scripts.

Core structure:
  scripts:    bspwm/bin
  assets:     bspwm/wallpaper

This system is actively used by me, so it evolves constantly.
If something breaks — it gets fixed.

I’m open to ideas, improvements, and feedback.

I also plan to create YouTube content about:
  - How the system works
  - Installation
  - Linux workflows and real usage
